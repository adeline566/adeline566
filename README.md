## Hi there, I'm Adeline!

🔐 Cybersecurity student at ODU | Future PenTester  
🔧 Breaking things to learn how to fix them  
💻 Currently building my home lab and documenting my journey  
😅 Hoping I don’t break my own network in the process  
📚 Growing my cybersecurity skills one project at a time  
⚡️Fun fact: I’m powered by logic, curiosity, and the occasional overthinking spiral.
